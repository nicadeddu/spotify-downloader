## Scope of Project
- This project is focused solely on providing a tool to download music from Spotify playlists.
- This project heavily follows the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle (Keep it simple, stupid) to make the code more understandable, manageable, and maintainable.
- To avoid possible conflicts, below are the tasks currently in progress by the team for reference:
    - Tests
    - More robust error checking systems
    - Graphical user interface

## Contribution Areas
We welcome contribution in the following areas:
- Documentation updates or improvements to make the project easier to understand and use.
